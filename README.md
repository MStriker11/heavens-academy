# Heaven's Academy
Online 2v2 Multiplayer First Person Game in Unity

# Overview
The game was inspired from the popular franchise Overwatch, and is similar in the sense that it shares a first person POV with abilities where players can shoot projectiles. This is an original project that was developed over the course of 3 months, and the game was presented to various UCSB students under Gaucho Gaming Lab. All assets used in the project were obtained there, and are not included in the commit.
